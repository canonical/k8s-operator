summary: A machine charm for K8s
description: |-
  A machine charm which operates a complete Kubernetes cluster.

  This charm installs and operates a Kubernetes cluster via the k8s snap. It exposes
  relations to co-operate with other kubernetes components such as optional CNIs,
  optional cloud-providers, optional schedulers, external backing stores, and external
  certificate storage.

  This charm provides the following running components:
  * kube-apiserver
  * kube-scheduler
  * kube-controller-manager
  * kube-proxy
  * kubelet
  * containerd

  This charm can optionally disable the following components:
  * A Kubernetes Backing Store
  * A Kubernetes CNI
