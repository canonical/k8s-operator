summary: A machine charm for K8s
description: |-
  A machine charm which operates a complete Kubernetes cluster.

  This charm installs and operates a Kubernetes cluster via the k8s snap. It exposes
  relations to co-operate with other kubernetes components such as optional CNIs,
  optional cloud-providers, optional schedulers, external backing stores, and external
  certificate storage.

  This charm provides the following running components:
  * kube-apiserver
  * kube-scheduler
  * kube-controller-manager
  * kube-proxy
  * kubelet
  * containerd

  This charm can optionally disable the following components:
  * A Kubernetes Backing Store
  * A Kubernetes CNI

    annotations:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: |
        Annotations is a space separated list of (key/value) pairs)  that can be
        used to add arbitrary metadata configuration to the Canonical
        Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see the upstream Canonical
        Kubernetes documentation about annotations:

        https://documentation.ubuntu.com/canonical-kubernetes/latest/snap/reference/annotations/

        Example:
          e.g.: key1=value1 key2=value2
    bootstrap-datastore:
      default: dqlite
      type: string
      description: |
        The datastore to use in Canonical Kubernetes. This cannot be changed
        after deployment. Allowed values are "dqlite" and "etcd". If "etcd" is
        chosen, the charm should be integrated with the etcd charm.

      type: string
      default: ""
      description: |
        Space-separated list of taints to apply to this node at registration time.

        This config is only used at bootstrap time when Kubelet first registers the
        node with Kubernetes. To change node taints after deploy time, use kubectl
        instead.

        For more information, see the upstream Kubernetes documentation about
        taints:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/

        and one for IPv6.

        After deployment it is not possible to change the size of

    containerd-custom-registries:

      description: |
        Registry endpoints and credentials. Setting this config allows containerd
        to pull images from registries where auth is required.

        The value for this config must be a JSON array of credential objects, like this:
          e.g.: [{"url": "https://registry.example.com", "host": "my.registry:port", "username": "user", "password": "pass"}]

        Credential Object Parameters:
        url: REQUIRED str
          the URL to the registry, include the port if not it isn't implied from the schema.
            e.g: "url": "https://my.registry:8443"
            e.g: "url": "http://my.registry"

        host: OPTIONAL str - defaults to auto-generated from the url
          could be registry host address or a name
            e.g.: myregistry.io:9000, 10.10.10.10:5432
            e.g.: myregistry.io, myregistry
          Note: It will be derived from `url` if not provided.
            e.g.: "url": "http://10.10.10.10:8000" --> "host": "10.10.10.10:8000"

        username: OPTIONAL str - default ''
        password: OPTIONAL str - default ''
        identitytoken: OPTIONAL str - default ''

        ca_file: OPTIONAL str - default ''
        cert_file: OPTIONAL str - default ''
        key_file: OPTIONAL str - default ''
          For ssl/tls communication these should be a base64 encoded file
          e.g.:  "ca_file": "'"$(base64 -w 0 < my.custom.registry.pem)"'"

        skip_verify: OPTIONAL bool - default false
          For situations where the registry has self-signed or expired certs and a quick work-around is necessary.
          e.g.: "skip_verify": true

        Example config:
        juju config k8s containerd_custom_registries='[{
            "url": "https://registry.example.com",
            "host": "ghcr.io",
