summary: A machine charm for K8s
description: |-
  A machine charm which operates a complete Kubernetes cluster.

  This charm installs and operates a Kubernetes cluster via the k8s snap. It exposes
  relations to co-operate with other kubernetes components such as optional CNIs,
  optional cloud-providers, optional schedulers, external backing stores, and external
  certificate storage.

  This charm provides the following running components:
  * kube-apiserver
  * kube-scheduler
  * kube-controller-manager
  * kube-proxy
  * kubelet
  * containerd

  This charm can optionally disable the following components:
  * A Kubernetes Backing Store
  * A Kubernetes CNI

config:
  options:
    datastore:
      default: dqlite
      type: string
      description: |
        The datastore to use in Canonical Kubernetes. This cannot be changed
        after deployment. Allowed values are "dqlite" and "etcd". If "etcd" is
        chosen, the charm should be integrated with the etcd charm.
    labels:
      default: ""
      type: string
      description: |
        Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of nodes in the
        cluster. Declare node labels in key=value format, separated by spaces.      
    register-with-taints:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: |
        Space-separated list of taints to apply to this node at registration time.

        This config is only used at deploy time when Kubelet first registers the
        node with Kubernetes. To change node taints after deploy time, use kubectl
        instead.

        For more information, see the upstream Kubernetes documentation about
        taints:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/
    service-cidr:
      type: string
      default: 10.152.183.0/24
      description: |
        CIDR to use for Kubernetes services. After deployment it is
        only possible to increase the size of the IP range. It is not possible to
        change or shrink the address range after deployment.
