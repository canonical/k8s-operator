        The certificates generation strategy to use in Canonical Kubernetes.
        This cannot be changed after deployment. Allowed values are "self-signed"
        and "external". If "external" is chosen, the charm should be integrated
        with the an external certificates authority charm.
    labels:
      default: ""
      type: string
      description: |
        Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of nodes in the
        cluster. Declare node labels in key=value format, separated by spaces.
        
        Note: Due to NodeRestriction, workers are limited to how they can label themselves
