config:
  options:
    bootstrap-node-taints:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: |
        Space-separated list of taints to apply to this node at registration time.

        This config is only used at bootstrap time when Kubelet first registers the
        node with Kubernetes. To change node taints after deploy time, use kubectl
        instead.

        For more information, see the upstream Kubernetes documentation about
        taints:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/
    node-labels:
      default: ""
      type: string
      description: |
        Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of nodes in the
        cluster. Declare node labels in key=value format, separated by spaces.

        Note: Due to NodeRestriction, workers are limited to how they can label themselves

        Space separated list of flags and key=value pairs that will be passed as arguments to
        kube-proxy.

        Notes:
          Options may only be set on charm deployment

        For example a value like this:
          runtime-config=batch/v2alpha1=true profiling=true
        will result in kube-proxy being run with the following options:
          --runtime-config=batch/v2alpha1=true --profiling=true
    kubelet-extra-args:
      type: string
      default: ""

        For example a value like this:

      Override charm defined snap installation script

      This charm is designed to operate with a specific revision of snaps, overriding
      with anything will indicate that the charm is running an unsupported configuration.

      0-byte resource (Default) -- Use the charm defined snap installation script
      ./snap-installation.yaml  -- Overrides the charm defined snap-installation.yaml
      ./k8s_XXXX.snap           -- Overrides the charm with a specific snap file installed dangerously
