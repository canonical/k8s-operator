## Structure of the charms

The `k8s` and `k8s-worker` charms are noticeably tucked into one-another.  

```
└── worker
    ├── charmcraft.yaml
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── k8s
        ├── charmcraft.yaml
        ├── lib
        │   └── charms/...
        ├── requirements.txt
        └── src
            └── charm.py
```

While unfamiliar to some charm developers, this lets both charms share the exact same `src` folder. This is accomplished by using the `parts.charm.charm-entrypoint` value in the `worker` directory set to `k8s/src/charm.py`.

### What's unique

The unique parts of the charm are what are in each charm's top-level directory:

```
charmcraft.yaml
config.yaml
actions.yaml
metadata.yaml
requirements.yaml
```

In order to exclude the `k8s` exclusive components from the `k8s-worker` charm, charmcraft will read the `worker/.jujuignore` file to determine what to leave out of the final charm.

### What's not

The shared portions of each charm are within `worker/k8s` (except for the above mentioned exclusions).  This includes shared libraries from `worker/k8s/lib`, shared source from `worker/k8s/src`, shared python dependencies from `worker/k8s/requirements.txt`

### How to distinguish which charm code should engage

The charm can distinguish whether it's a `control-plane` or `worker` unit by using `self.is_worker` or `self.is_control_plane` by querying its metadata.

### Why two charms?

Much of the charm's behavior will be identical. They will employ many of the same relations, many of the same resources, configure the same snap, and use many of the same configuration options. One might therefore assume the two should be 1 charm. History with Charmed Kubernetes has proven that having 2 charms split between control-plane and worker has advantages when a relation is split across `requires` and `provides`.

### Why not use a charm library?

Sharing code between a charm library is a really reasonable idea, there are limitations that a charm library presents:
* limited to a single file
* PRs where the library changes doesn't reflect in the secondary charm
* updating a second charm isn't immediate 
    - must upload to charmhub, then download into the secondary charms

### How to use two charms in the same code base:

In cases where the charms should diverge the behavior, use a runtime switch to make the decision

```python
if self.is_control_plane:
    # do control-plane only thing
    ...
# do more common things
...
if self.is_worker:
    # do worker only thing
    ...
```
